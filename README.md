# YGOCards_Downloader-Fork

## Changes:

- It now downloads the card art instead of full card images.
- Updated cards database text file to the current cards as of 2020-04-09
- Deleted old build, use **MainProg.py** to download and first install the requirements (which is just PyQt5).

This program automatically skips the already downloaded images, it only downloads one image at a time.
