# YGOCards_Downloader-Fork

## Changes:

- It now downloads the card art instead of full card images.
- Updated cards database text file to the current cards as of 2020-04-09
- Deleted old build, use **MainProg.py** to download and first install the requeriments (which is just PyQt5).

The program automatically skips the already download images, it only download one image at a time.
